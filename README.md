# Olympic-Games-Analysis
_Olympic games are held every 4 years, it advocates peace among nations via sports._  

In this project, we perform an exploratory data analysis on Summer Olympics from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 and figure out some useful patterns out of the data.

Our analysis on Olympic games data provided insights about country wise success rate; participation of males and females in the events and its pattern over years; relation between height, weight and medals,etc.

Further, we also dig deeper into India specific ranking for different sports and athletes.

We have established basic relations between different features and in future we can also include particular sports, athlete, country,etc. to get focused insights on their perfomance in these games.
